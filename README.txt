In order to run this project, open all of the classes and press play. Make sure to have your volume turned on.

The game is played in that you must move the paddle to try to hit the ball by using the left and right arrow keys. Along with hitting the ball, you should try to hit the coins in order to earn extra points. This must be done before the timer in the top right corner reaches is filled. Each time you hit the paddle, you gain 1 point. Each time you hit the coins, you gain 100 points. The score appears in the upper left corner. The level completes when time runs out. You lose 1 life each time the paddle misses the ball (you start with 3). You always have the option of going on to the next level until you either run out of time or lose all of your lives. In each level, the ball moves slightly faster.

Extra Credit:
Sounds: There is a “pew” sound each time the ball hits the paddle.
	There is a “tada” sound each time you pass a level.
	There is a “wuh wuh wuh” sound when you lose.
	There is constant background music.
Non-stationary Obstacles: When the user hits the coins, they gain 100 points. There are 5 possible coins for the user to get each round. They disappear once the ball has hit them.
